- MRecon gridder doenst work yet for 3D 

- Greengard gridding fails for iterativev reconstructions, no idea why

- MRecongridder requires a fftshift in 3rd dimension after second grid step (coil maps is first), no idea why

- Noise prewhitening does not seem to work
- 3D NUFFT operator require an additional fftshift, which in case of Z=31 is Z-1.8 ?? No idea why
